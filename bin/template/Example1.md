# First example of a markdown file

This is an example of what a markdown file should look like.
- Language: markdown
- Author: Marcello Bachechi
- Buy me a ko-fi? [https://ko-fi.com/marcellobachechi](https://ko-fi.com/marcellobachechi)

This comes after the second example because of the `order` property in the `config.json` file.

You can format code like this:
```html
<html>
    <h1> TEST </h1>
</html>
```
or even this:
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```
